As the colourful, non-removable pegs on the bench go up and down, they play peekaboo, taking turns showing their friendly smiles while the child has fun practicing fine motor skills.\n\nParent will love that the pegs are attached so they can't get lost. Children delight in striking a peg with the mallet and watching one on the opposite side pop up. Once kids have seen this cause-and-effect in action, they will enjoy predicting which peg will pop up next.\n\nAs they develop hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills, they will also be learning numbers and colours by counting the pegs and naming each colour as it pops up.\n\nThe Melissa and Doug Deluxe Pounding Bench Wooden Toy makes a great gift for kids 2 to 4 years. A sturdy wooden mallet is included.",
